Abstract
In recent years, IoT devices have surged globally, enhancing businesses, industries,
and daily life. Nevertheless, IoT devices are not immune to cyber attacks. On the
contrary, their limited memory and processing power make them more susceptible
to malicious attacks. Therefore, developing a lightweight yet efficient attack detection
is a critical issue for IoT systems. This research proposes an efficient lightweight
hybrid deep learning model (DNN-BiLSTM) to detect and classify attacks in an IoT
system utilizing improved feature engineering and advanced quantization. Although
leveraging hybrid deep learning model that combines DNN and BiLSTM facilitates
the extraction of intricate network features in a nonlinear and bidirectional manner,
aiding in the identification of complex attack patterns and behaviors, tailoring this for
IoT devices remains challenging. To address the constraints inherent to IoT devices,
this research incorporates improved feature engineering techniques, specifically
Redundancy-Adjusted Logistic Mutual Information Feature Selection (RAL-MIFS) with
a two-stage Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) algorithm. Additionally,
advanced quantization techniques, including Quantization Aware Training (QAT)
and Post-Training Dynamic Quantization (PTDQ), alongside advanced Optuna for
hyperparameter optimization, are utilized to enhance computational efficiency
without compromising detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations were conducted
on the CIC-IDS2017 and CIC-IoT2023 datasets to assess the performance of a
quantized DNN-BiLSTMQ model. The model demonstrated competitive detection
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods,
including autoencoder + ensamble learning, LNN and CNN-BiLSTM. Using the CIC-
IDS2017 dataset, a detection accuracy of 99.73% is achieved with a model size of
just 25.6 KB, while on the CIC-IoT2023 dataset, the achieved a detection accuracy
is 93.95% with a model size of 31.3 KB. These results highlight the potential of
quantized DNN-BiLSTMQ model for efficient and accurate cyber attack detection on
IoT systems.

1  Introduction
1.1  The overview

The  rapid  advancement  and  adoption  of  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  technology  have
resulted  in  its  extensive  integration  across  a  wide  range  of  applications  and  services.
Despite the promising potential of IoT technology, its rapid proliferation has increased
the attack surface, rendering IoT environments susceptible to a broad spectrum of cyber
threats  and  attacks.  These  vulnerabilities  arise  from  limitations  in  processing  power,
storage, memory, and communication capabilities inherent in the small, energy-efficient
endpoint devices comprising IoT infrastructures.

The  global  adoption  of  smart  sensors  has  accelerated  due  to  their  effectiveness  in
enhancing  business  operations,  industrial  workflows,  and  daily  routines.  These  tech-
nologies  are  increasingly  integrated  into  diverse  sectors,  including  healthcare,  smart
homes, smart cities, and smart grids [1]. However, despite their widespread use, many
IoT devices remain vulnerable to security threats. Their limited computational resources
and  connectivity  constraints  make  them  particularly  susceptible,  potentially  leading  to
disruptions and compromised functionality across interconnected systems.

In 2020, it was predicted that global spending on IoT technology would reach 749 bil-
lion dollars [2]. IoT systems continue to proliferate, connected and distributed across a
broad range of services and applications. Utilization of IoT devices all over the globe is
expected to pass 125 billion in 2030 [3].

The growing data capacity and connectivity of IoT devices increase their vulnerability
to cyber threats, necessitating robust detection and classification systems. Conventional
machine  learning  models  often  struggle  with  high  false  positive  rates  [4]  and  limited
adaptability  to  emerging  attack  patterns.  While  deep  learning  models  effectively  cap-
ture  complex  patterns  in  network  traffic,  their  deployment  in  IoT  environments  faces
challenges due to cost, scalability, and resource constraints [5–9]. Additionally, large fea-
ture  sets  can  increase  model  complexity,  further  straining  limited  IoT  resources.  This
highlights the need for efficient, lightweight, and real-time detection models suitable for
resource-constrained  environments.  Ensuring  model  generalizability  across  varied  IoT
environments  is  also  difficult,  as  models  trained  on  specific  datasets  may  fail  to  adapt
effectively  to  diverse  real-world  scenarios  [8].  Addressing  this  challenge  requires  the
design of advanced learning methodologies that can effectively manage heterogeneous
data and dynamic conditions commonly found in IoT deployments.

To  address  these  challenges,  this  research  proposes  a  resource-efficient  hybrid  deep
learning  model  specifically  designed  for  IoT  security.  The  model  leverages  advanced
dynamic quantization techniques, QAT and PTDQ, to enhance performance in resource
constrained  environments  without  compromising  detection  accuracy.  Additionally,  it

incorporates robust feature engineering methods, including RAL-MIFS and a two-stage
IPCA, to reduce dataset dimensionality by extracting the most relevant features. By min-
imizing model size and reducing false positives, this research strengthens the resilience
and  reliability  of  IoT  networks  against  emerging  cyber  threats,  ensuring  efficient  and
precise attack detection and categorization.

2.1  Cyber attack detection for IoT

The  proliferation  of  computers,  smartphones,  and  other  internet-enabled  devices  has
made the world vulnerable to cyber attacks. confidentiality and safety challenges are also
evolving and increasing as the IoT touches everyone every day [10, 11]. Additionally, the
security threats exposed by IoT devices have varying impacts depending on the domain
in which they operate. Each device can suffer from unique vulnerabilities specific to the
characteristics, processes, and requirements of its domain, such as smart grids, indus-
trial applications, and autonomous vehicles, smart home, healthcare, smart city.

The  continued  rise  in  information  leaks  and  attacks  from  IoT  devices  has  led  to  an
acceleration  and  increase  in  privacy  and  security  research  in  the  literature  [12,  13].
Therefore,  the  need  for  early  detection  of  intrusive  activity  to  mitigate  the  negative
impact of these devices is more urgent than ever. As a result, standard intrusion detec-
tion techniques are being improved by incorporating machine learning techniques [14–
16]. [17] a proposed network traffic analyzer and machine learning approach to prevent
botnet attacks.

[14]  made  use  of  the  perks  of  swarm  intelligence  (SI)  techniques  to  present  a  novel
feature  engineering  strategy  for  the  attack  recognition  system.  BoT-IoT,  NSL-KDD,
CIC2017,  and  KDD99  are  well-known  public  datasets  that  were  utilized  to  assess  the
efficacy  of  the  suggested  cyber  attack  detection  method.  For  cyber  attack  detection,
three  sophisticated  and  popular  DL  models  were  proposed  by  [18].  CNN,  LSTM,  and
a CNN-LSTM hybrid model experiment were carried out by the authors. They assessed
these DL models usage of the IoTID20 dataset. Conventional network attack detection
techniques can be effectively enhanced with machine learning technology.

As  per  [19],  a  novel  hybrid  intrusion  detection  system  (HIDS)  called  Hybrid  CRNN
attack  Detection  System  (HCRNNIDS)  has  been  introduced,  employing  convolutional
recurrent  neural  network.  This  system  integrate  the  strengths  of  convolutional  neural
networks (CNNs) for extraction of local features and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
for capturing temporal features. By harnessing these techniques, the HCRNNIDS dem-
onstrates  significant  advancements  in  cyber  attack  detection,  achieving  remarkable
accuracy rates of 97.75% in detecting malicious cyber attacks on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018
dataset  under  10-fold  cross-validation.  This  innovative  approach  outperforms  conven-
tional cyber-attack detection methodologies, marking a substantial stride towards more
effective cybersecurity measures in network environments.

2.2  Improved feature engineering for cyber attack detection on IoT

Feature  engineering  is  indispensable  in  the  realm  of  cyber  threat  detection  within
the  IoT  environments,  as  it  aids  in  extracting  relevant  information  from  raw  data,
thereby  enabling  the  development  of  simple  and  accurate  detection  systems.  Recent
research  [20],  investigated  feature  engineering  techniques  leveraging  deep  learning

Misrak and Melaku Discover Internet of Things            (2025) 5:97 Page 4 of 34

methodologies. CNNs and RNNs were used to extract complex patterns from IoT net-
work traffic, significantly enhancing attack detection accuracy.

[21] Proposed improved feature selection method named Logistic Redundancy Coef-
ficient Gradual Upweighting MIFS that assesses individual features instead of checking
them with same characteristics of the already selected features. In contrast to other fea-
ture selection methods currently in use, logistic function was used to determine a fea-
ture’s redundancy score.

[8]  Used  incremental  principal  component  analysis  (IPCA)  techniques  for  feature
dimension reduction. IPCA learn incrementally data features and is more convenient for
real-time monitoring of the network traffic within IoT environment.

A  novel  feature  engineering  strategy  and  DCNN-based  model  for  identifying  evil-
intended  attacks  in  Internet  of Things  networks  are  presented  by  [6].  Optimizing  per-
formance  while  lowering  computational  power  was  the  goal.  The  suggested  model
successfully lowers computing power while increasing performance. For binary classifi-
cation, they get 98.12%, and for multiclassification of 77.0% accuracy.

Additionally, recent advancements in this field include the work of [22], who proposed
a unique feature engineering strategy based on the algorithm GNNs for IoT cyber attack
detection.  Their  method  effectively  captures  the  complex  relationships  and  dependen-
cies  among  IoT  devices  and  their  communications,  thereby  enhancing  the  robustness
and accuracy of cyber attack recognition in IoT environments.

2.3  Lightweight cyber attack detection model

Much effort has been expended over the past ten years to address security problems are
connected to detecting cyber attacks in IoT systems. Many of these anomaly-based ADS
systems are developed employing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) tech-
niques to enable intelligent cyber security decisions.

Thus, feature preprocessing and data engineering formed the central part of the DL-
based  ADS  model. This  has  been  crucial  in  enabling  the  raw  data  gathered  within  the
ecosystem of IoT to be analyzed and predicted further [23]. They found highly encourag-
ing results by applying model of deep neural network on two chosen IoT gateways, with
an average increase in network bandwidth of less than 30 kb/s and a CPU consumption
increase  of  only  2%.  On  the  two  datasets  that  were  used,  the  ML  models  were  able  to
show almost 93% detection accuracy and 92% f1-score [24].

[8]  Employed  dynamic  quantization  to  trim  specified  model  cell  structure,  thereby
reduce the computational complication on devices while maintaining accurate detection
ablity.

Additionally,  the  study  by  [25]  used  a  multi-stage  classification  method  by  applying
clustering  with  oversampling  to  analyze  the  same  dataset  and  predict  the  intrusion’s
existence. It merely recognizes the presence of attacks; it cannot, however, forecast the
kind of the attacks. When feature/data engineering techniques are not used, it can often
be  more  challenging  to  extract  pertinent  features  using  DL  algorithms  alone.  Industry
businesses  and  researchers  have  created  techniques  to  classify  the  data  and  identify
assaults by identifying important characteristics.

IoT traffic usually requires a huge amount of memory space and data capacity. How-
ever,  putting  cyber  attack-detection  and  classification  systems  by  high-performance
deep  learning  techniques  based  on  IoT  devices  can  be  difficult  in  some  situations  due

to  resource  limitations.  Taking  into  account  the  computational  and  power  limitations
of  edge  devices  (IoT),  [26]  performed  research  to  investigate  the  viability  of  utilizing
TPU of Google Edge for the implementation of an cyber attack detection system in edge
computing.  The  outcomes  show  how  TPUs  can  greatly  increase  a  system’s  processing
capacity,  making  it  possible  to  use  deep  learning  methods  for  edge  sensors.  For  com-
plex high-dimensional hidden layer data, [27] developed a lengthy short-term memory
autoencoder technique to produce low-dimensional intrinsic spatial representations of
features.

Employing a hybrid BiLSTM technique, [28] achieved the highest possible data reduc-
tion  rate  is  91.89%  for  classifying  cyber  Employing  a  hybrid  BiLSTM  technique,  [28]
achieved the highest possible data reduction rate is 91.89% for classifying cyber attacks,
both  in  binary  and  multiclass  classification  studies,  using  the  BoT-IoT  classical  botnet
dataset. Through their research, [28] showcased the accuracy, sensitivity, and efficacy of
this lightweight cyber attack-detection method against the three distinct kinds of Sybil
assaults.

[29] proposed a lightweight cyber attack detection system that transforms raw network
traffic data into image representations. Using the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset, abnormal
traffic  features  were  encoded  as  images  and  classified  using  a  CNN-based  model.  The
system  was  validated  through  simulations  on  two  encrypted  traffic  datasets,  achieving
95%  accuracy  with  a  reasonable  detection  time,  utilizing  relatively  small  training  data
sizes.

[30]  proposed  a  GWO-GA  hybrid  for  dimensionality  reduction  in  wireless  traffic
data. Evaluated using SVM, the method achieved a 68% reduction in feature space and
decreased computation time.

Similarly,  [31]  proposed  the  self-encoder  approach.  Through  experimental  analysis
on  an  IoT  cyberattack  detection  dataset,  it  is  demonstrated  that  the  model  with  light-
weight capability exhibits high cyber attack-detection accuracy, surpassing most classi-
cal optimizers.

The study [32] introduces an innovative approach combining Binary Arithmetic Opti-
mization  with  Sparse  Autoencoder  models  to  efficently  identify  and  classify  network
intrusions. This hybrid BAOA-SAE method prioritizes prominent feature selection from
network data to enhance detection accuracy.

From the various lightweight IoT cyber attack detection scheme approaches discussed
above, it can be deduced that the majority of studies focus on two main aspects: dimen-
sion  reduction  of  features  for  dataset  preprocessing  and  model  lightweighting  to  con-
serve  memory  capacity  and  Internet  of  Things  device  processing  power.  Furthermore,
researchers have begun integrating optimization algorithms help overcome these obsta-
cles and improve the efficacy of IoT settings’ cyber attack identification systems.

2.4  Summary and research gap

Through the review of various papers and research works, several significant gaps have
come to light.

The  First  critical  gap  lies  in  dataset  preprocessing  part.  Effective  feature  engineering
mechanisms  are  essential  to  reduce  dataset  dimensions  and  optimize  it  for  IoT  mod-
els.  The  accuracy  and  performance  of  these  models  are  heavily  contingent  upon  the
dataset’s quality. Feature engineering involves the removal of unnecessary features and

Misrak and Melaku Discover Internet of Things            (2025) 5:97 Page 6 of 34

the  extraction  of  new  ones  to  bolster  accuracy.  Eliminating  irrelevant  features  is  cru-
cial to mitigate overfitting and under-learning, which can significantly impact classifier
performance and execution time. An exhaustive data preprocessing with improved fea-
ture  engineering  architecture  is  necessary  to  enhance  system  performance.  Thus,  our
approach entails providing such a framework, complete with meticulous development,
validation environments, and configurations.

Secondly,  algorithm  complexity  stands  out  as  the  primary  gap.  Many  existing  deep
learning solutions are excessively intricate and prone to overfitting. Given the resource-
constraints of IoT devices, algorithms must be lightweight for real-time use. Therefore,
we aim to develop lightweight algorithms tailored for IoT deployment. These algorithms
was optimized to operate within the limited memory and computational power of IoT
devices.

Thirdly,  while  much  research  emphasizes  identification  and  categorization  accuracy,

the efficiency of IoT systems in detecting cyber attacks is often overlooked.

In  summary,  addressing  these  gaps  necessitates  a  comprehensive  approach  that
encompasses model complexity, efficiency, dataset management, and algorithm optimi-
zation. By focusing on these aspects, we aim to develop more effective and efficient IoT-
based detection systems (Table 1).

IoT  applications.  Our  focus  was  on  conducting  cyber  attack  detection  experiments  to
verify the efficiency of our proposed cyber attack identification model prepared for IoT
environments. Below, we present a brief illustration of the datasets employed, along with
comprehensive details regarding the preprocessing stages undertaken.

3.2.1  Dataset overview

The  process  of  data  collection  involves  systematically  gathering  information  or  data
concerning  specific  variables  within  a  dataset  in  an  organized  manner.  This  enables
researchers to effectively address research questions, test hypotheses, and evaluate out-
comes. In the context of this research, the variables of interest pertain to cyberattacks
targeting data records within IoT computing environments. The chosen dataset was uti-
lized to assess the efficacy of an Attack Detection System (ADS) for IoT systems, as well
as  to  apply  various  data  engineering  techniques  aimed  at  enhancing  the  learning  and
validation processes. The study will encompass the examination of two prominent global
datasets relevant to IoT attacks, including CIC-IDS2017 and the CIC-IoT2023 dataset.

dataset used as a crucial resource for research in system security and cyber attack identi-
fication, encompassing a wide array of attack scenarios such as Botnet, Brute Force, DoS,
DDoS, Infiltration, SQL Injection, Port scan, and XSS. It fulfills the criteria outlined in
the dataset assessment method. In our study, we specifically focus on the subset of data
collected and generated on a Friday, tailored for the purpose of IoT attack detection. For
a comprehensive understanding, detailed explanation of CIC-IDS2017 datasets utilized
are provided in Table 2. Also for comparison purpose the same dataset used as used in
[8].

CIC-IoT2023 dataset is developed by Neto and colleagues in 2023, presents an exten-
sive compilation of IoT attacks. It encompasses 105 genuine IoT devices organized into
diverse  topologies,  simulating  a  smart  home  setting.  Within  this  dataset,  thirty-three
unique  attacks  are  labeled  into  nine  groups:  Brute  force,  DNS  spoofing,  DoS,  DDoS,
Recon, and Mirai. These attacks were performed, recorded, and collated within the IoT
environment. Notably, the dataset includes Recon attacks, which involve gathering com-
prehensive  target  data  from  the  IoT  architecture,  and  Mirai  attacks,  characterized  by
large-scale DDoS assaults on IoT devices. These attack categories represent both typical
and  innovative  kinds  of  IoT  traffic  attack.  This  research  concentrate  on  these  primary
cyber  attack categories and their categories for experimental purposes. Further details
regarding dataset can be observed in Table 3.

3.2.2  Data preprocessing

It  is  vital  to  preprocess  datasets  before  utilizing  it  in  deep  learning  architecture.  Data
sourced  from  real-world  environments  typically  harbor  numerous  errors  and  irregu-
larities, necessitating meticulous cleaning procedures. For instance, when encountering
string values within the dataset, it becomes essential to convert them into numerical for-
mat prior to deep learning training.

Misrak and Melaku Discover Internet of Things            (2025) 5:97 Page 9 of 34

Data preprocessing phase plays a significant role in preparing data for deep learning
techniques. It involves several steps to change real world sensor data into a more suit-
able format for neural networks. These steps typically include data cleaning for handling
missing values and outliers, label encoding to convert categorical variables into numeri-
cal format, feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones, nor-
malization  to  scale  features  to  a  similar  range.  This  preprocessing  procedure  for  the
attack identification system comprises five distinct stages, outlined as follows:

Dataset Cleaning
Prior to model training, it is essential to conduct a rigorous examination of datasets to
identify any instances containing missing or undefined values, ensuring both the accu-
racy of the input data and the reliability of the resulting model. In this study, preprocess-
ing was conducted using the PyTorch framework along with Python’s built-in libraries.
We  analyzed  the  CIC-IDS2017  and  CIC-IoT2023  datasets  and  identified  missing  and
infinite values, prompting a cleaning process. A three-step method involving converting
infinite values to NaN, imputing missing values with column means, and removing any
remaining  NaN  or  infinite  values.  As  missing  data  represented  only  0.000284%  of  the
total and had no impact on model accuracy according to our experiment, we opted for
direct removal to streamline preprocessing without affecting performance.

Label Encoding
Utilizing numerization is a recognized technique for handling categorical data, partic-
ularly in scenarios where memory efficiency and computational speed are crucial. Unlike
one-hot encoding, which can be memory-intensive and time-consuming, numerization
assigns a distinctive numeric value to each category within a categorical feature.

For  binary  experiments,  the  categorical  data  is  encoded  into  Zeros  and  ones,  where
zero  signifies  the  normal  class  and  one  indicates  the  attack  class.  Meanwhile,  in  mul-
ticlass  classification  experiments,  the  numeric  values  for  the  categorical  labels  are
incremented  accordingly.  For  example,  in  CIC-IoT2023  dataset,  Benign  class  is  repre-
sented  by  0,  Dos-TCP_flood  by  1,  DDos-TCP_flood  by  2,  DNS-Spoofing  by  3,  Recon-
PortScan by 4, Recon-OSScan by 5, Mirai-greeth_flood by 6, Mirai-udpplain by 7 and 8
to Mirai-greip_flood.

By employing numerization, we ensure that the categorical features are appropriately
converted  into  numerical  values,  facilitating  seamless  integration  into  deep  learning
models. This approach not only optimizes memory usage but also streamlines computa-
tional efficiency, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the training of the model.

Feature Engineering
In addressing the issue arising from the high-dimensional nature of the original data-
set’s  and  redendency  of  features,  feature  engineering  becomes  a  pivotal  aspect  of  this
research  endeavor.  Effective  feature  engineering  involves  identifying  and  transforming
real world sensor data into model understandable features that enhance model perfor-
mance. Techniques such as feature scaling, normalization, and extraction of relevant fea-
tures play a pivotal role in this process. Additionally, the selection of appropriate feature
dimensionality reduction methods is paramount to mitigate computational complexities
and improve model efficiency.

Feature  engineering  involves  the  process  of  either  eliminating  redundant  features  or
extracting new ones from existing features, aimed at enhancing the performance using
machine  learning  [41]).  Redundant  records  were  identified  and  eliminated  from  the

Misrak and Melaku Discover Internet of Things            (2025) 5:97 Page 10 of 34

dataset. Since each dataset possesses its unique feature set, it’s crucial to eliminate irrel-
evant features dimensions that are not critical to the output label. Retaining such insig-
nificant features can lead to overfitting or underfitting, thereby adversely affecting both
the execution time and classifier performance.

Employing Redundancy-Adjusted Logistic MIFS (RAL-MIFS) enhances feature engi-
neering  for  Cyber  Attack  Detection  Systems  (ADS)  by  refining  Mutual  Information
Feature  Selection  (MIFS).  By  adjusting  for  feature  redundancy  and  leveraging  logistic
weighting, RAL-MIFS prioritizes the most informative features. This approach improves
the  efficacy  and  accuracy  of  ADS,  ensuring  better  detection  of  attacks  in  complex
datasets.

The  original  dataset’s  high-dimensional  features  pose  challenges  for  the  proposed
light-weight  attack  detection  model.  To  address  this,  selecting  an  appropriate  feature
dimension  reduction  method  is  crucial.  In  this  investigation,  we  propose  RAL-MIFS
combined  with  two-stage  IPCA  approach  to  solve  the  issue  of  high-dimensional  fea-
tures. The two-stage IPCA method involves performing IPCA in sequential stages, each
stage  refining  the  dimensionality  reduction  process  further.  This  approach  efficiently
transforms  high-dimensional  features  into  lower-dimensional  representations  through
mapping functions, thereby facilitating dimensionality reduction. By employing a two-
stage IPCA approach, we target to optimize the reduction of feature dimensions while
preserving the relevant information necessary for accurate attack detection.

Through the usage of feature engineering techniques and the innovative RAL-MIFS +
two-stage IPCA method, the aim is to enhance the features quality and relevance used
in our light-weight attack detection model. By transforming the data from sensors which
is raw into a more meaningful representation and refining the dimensionality reduction
process iteratively, we can improve the model capacity to discern patterns and anomalies
effectively. This ensures that our model is not only efficient but also capable of accurately
identifying and classifying various attack types within the dataset.

Normalization
It is a technique manly used in preprocessing of dataset for DL algorithms. The aim
of  normalization  is  to  change  the  numeric  column  values  in  a  data  to  a  uniform  scale
while keeping changes in value bounds. Each feature of CIC-IDS2017 dataset, and CIC-
IoT2023  dataset  has  unique  values.  A  certain  amount  of  feature  values  reach  into  the
thousands, and some may contain negative figures that degrade the model performance.
To solve this challenge, the dataset was normalized between zero and one via min max
technique, as shown in Eq. 1.The data is transformed into a NumPy array and resized to
match the total number of records and input features utilizing Python’s NumPy library.

Data Splitting

Break apart the data to train, test, and validation sets is the widely used preprocessing
steps used to investigate the DL models’ performance. When dealing with balanced data,
it is advantageous to utilize random sampling due to its simplicity and ability to repre-
sent the entire dataset. Random sampling is effective in creating subsets that are repre-
sentative  of  the  whole  dataset  without  introducing  systematic  bias.  Random  sampling
was  employed  to  partition  the  dataset  into  training,  validation,  and  test  sets,  thereby

Misrak and Melaku Discover Internet of Things            (2025) 5:97 Page 11 of 34

maintaining a representative distribution across all subsets. After we normalize the data-
set, each matrix value will have a value between zero and one. For the data partitioning
procedure, data is randomly divided into into 80 % training, 20% testing, and then fur-
ther divide the training set to training and validation 80% and 20% respectively. Finally,
data was fed to deep learning model.

3.3  Proposed lightweighting architecture

In recent years, the demand for lightweight and efficient cyber attack detection systems
has surged due to the proliferation of IoT devices of constrained processing capabilities.
However, existing models often fall short in meeting these requirements, as they entail
high  computational  costs  and  are  unsuitable  for  widespread  deployment.  The  emer-
gence  of  CNN,  BiLSTM  and  DNN  has  shown  promise  in  addressing  these  challenges,
yet research in this area remains limited. While CNN-based classifiers excel in managing
diverse datasets, their application in attack detection has only recently gained traction,
outperforming traditional approaches [42]. To capitalize on this advancement, our study
proposes an innovative model that integrates a DNN with BiLSTM, showcasing excep-
tional  performance  in  identifying  various  network  anomalies  and  malicious  assaults.
Despite the outstanding performance of BILSTM and DNN, our hybrid approach offers
a robust solution for lightweight cyber attack recognition in IoT environments [43].

In  this  investigation,  a  lightweight  deep  learning-based  neural  network  cyber  attack
identification and classification scheme that incorporates RAL-MIFS + two stage feature
dimension reduction and advanced dynamic model quantization is proposed to stream-
line the detection model complication. The outcome is a model that maintains low com-
putational complication while achieving best detection accuracy.

The following are the phases of the suggested method for detecting IoT attacks: First,
as explained in Sect 3.2.2, the IoT cyber attack detection and classification dataset is pre-
processed  through  data  encoding  or  numerization,  data  cleaning,  feature  engineering
(RAL-MIFS), and two stage IPCA algorithm. The preprocessed data was divided to test,
training,  and  validation  category.  The  test  set  confirms  the  final  model’s  classification
performance, while the training and validation data are utilized for training the model
and weight fine tuning. After that, training and validation data are fed into DNN-BiL-
STM model and quantization aware training was performed.

To determine the proper parameters of the proposed system, the hyperparameters of
the  model  are  then  optimized  using  the  optuna  optimization  techniques.  The  trained
optimal model is then subjected to advanced dynamic quantization (Quantization Aware
Training and Post training dynamic quantization) by means of structural unit specifica-
tions.  The  quantized  DNN-BiLSTMQ  model  is  generated,  and  the  ultimate  identifica-
tion performance of the final model is assessed through rigorous testing of the reduced
size quantized model with the designated test set.

The proposed general architecture of lightweight deep learning based IoT cyber attack
identification  and  categorization  method  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  1,  comprising  four  main
modules: data preprocessing, quantization aware model training and weight fine tuning,
post training model dynamic quantization, and model categorization testing. This com-
prehensive  architecture  aims  to  enhance  intrusion  detection  efficiency  while  minimiz-
ing  computational  resources,  ensuring  effective  protection  against  cyber  attack  in  IoT
environments.

Fig. 1  Proposed lightweight hybrid deep learning architecture

Ensuring  accurate  evaluation  of  the  deep  learning  model’s  performance  necessitates
proper data splitting into train, test, and validation sets. To address potential issues aris-
ing  from  unbalanced  datasets,  we  employ  a  stratified  splitting  method.  Following  nor-
malization, data is divided into 80 % training, 20% testing, and then further divide the
training set to training and validation 80% and 20% respectively.

The  research  focuses  on  model  lightweighting  for  IoT  cyber-attack  detection,  In  the
subsequent  sections,  the  proposed  architecture  will  be  described  in  detail.  Beginning
with  data  preprocessing,  improved  feature  engineering  was  applied,  which  includes
RAL-MIFS and a two-stage IPCA process, as detailed in Sect. 3.4. Following this, we will
develop a hybrid DNN-BiLSTM model, which comprises a DNN and BiLSTM architec-
ture for intricate feature extraction as described in Sect. 3.5. The training of this model
will incorporate quantization-aware training.

Then the developed hybrid model parameters will be optimized using advanced optuna
parameter optimization, as detailed in Sect. 3.7, to achive the best accuracy and while
reducing model size. Then to create lightweight model, we will apply advanced dynamic
quantization,  which  integrates  quantization-aware  training  with  dynamic  quantization
after  training,  as  described  in  Sect.  3.6. This  comprehensive  approach  aims  to  achieve
a  lightweight  yet  highly  accurate  model  by  systematically  optimizing  each  stage  of  the
development process.

3.4  Improved feature engineering

When real time sensor and system data directly inputted to neural network, unimport-
ant redundant attributes in the real time sensor and system data typically make learn-
ing  process  harder,  which  definitely  has  a  adverse  impact  on  the  efficacy  of  the  cyber
attack identification of entire system. The determination of relationships between input
and target variables may necessitate a considerable number of instances, particularly in
scenarios where the input data contains ample information but suffers from high dimen-
sionality.  Feature  reduction  presents  a  viable  solution  to  these  challenges,  comprising
two primary techniques: feature selection and extraction. Feature selection involves the
identification and retention of pertinent inputs from the raw dataset, whereas extraction
of feature entails the derivation of new parameters from the original dataset, encapsulat-
ing the most pertinent information relevant to the output variable.

3.4.1  Redundancy-adjusted logistic MIFS

Employing  Redundancy-Adjusted  Logistic  MIFS  (RAL-MIFS)  enhances  feature  engi-
neering for cyber attack Identification Systems by refining MIFS. By adjusting for feature
redundancy and leveraging logistic weighting, RAL-MIFS prioritizes the most informa-
tive features. This approach improves the efficacy and accuracy of ADS, ensuring better
detection of attacks in complex datasets.

As  stated  in  [9],  MIFS  is  a  popular  system  for  feature  identification  that  can  effec-
tively  choose  important  features  aside  from  data  distribution,  which  makes  best  for
early attack detection architecture where data have no sufficient attack patterns. Unlike
existing MIFS that calculate k using Eq. (2), we proposeed RAL-MIFS that calculate the
redundancy using Eq. (3). Rather than updating k value linearly, the RAL-MIFS gradu-
ally rise weights whenever a new attributes is appended to the dataset.

has emerged as the prevailing method for feature reduction in prior research on attack
detection  systems,  offering  enhanced  lightweight  performance  via  its  low-complex-
ity  linear  transformation  approach.  Variants  of  PCA  have  been  extensively  applied  for
reduction  of  feature  dimensionality  in  attack  detection  datasets,  reflecting  its  ongoing
relevance. In such contexts, full-fledged training data may not be acquired at once, and
gradual  increase  in  data  traffic  may  lead  to  subtle  alterations  in  cyber  attack  behavior
from the dataset. Consequently, features extracted from initially provided training sam-
ples may lack persuasiveness, underscoring the desire for more adaptable and efficient
feature reduction techniques in dynamic IoT settings.

3.4.2  Two stage IPCA

This  study  also  introduces  the  two-stage  IPCA  for  Detecting  and  classifying  cyber
attacks, as a improvement for the PCA algorithm. IPCA, an incremental learning-based
reduction of feature dimensionality method suggested by [44], facilitates the incremen-
tal updating of feature vectors and values. Below is a concise outline of the reduction of
dimensionality  principle  employed  by  the  IPCA  algorithm  [44].  The  high  dimensional
data  samples  will  be  denoted  as  X = [x1, x2, . . . , xm]
  in  an  n-dimensional
space,  and  mean  of  X  will  be  computed  from  that.  MX( ¯X, Uk, Λk)  is  the  eigenspace
model of the raw dataset. Consider the new sample data Z

feature vectors and values in the vector feature space hinges on if the newly updated data

by the following equation:

3.4.3  RAL-MISF + two stage IPCA pseudocode

As  shown  in  the  Algorithm  1  the  original  dataset  undergoes  feature  selection  using
RAL-MIFS  to  identify  the  optimal  features.  RAL-MIFS  leverages  mutual  information

and  redundancy  adjustment  through  logistic  functions  to  prioritize  features  that  con-
tribute most significantly to the variable of interest while minimizing redundancy. This
step ensures that the most vital features are retained, enhancing the subsequent analysis.
The enhanced dataset, containing the selected features, is then input into the first stage
of IPCA, resulting in an updated dataset. This updated dataset is subsequently fed into
the second stage of IPCA, yielding the final updated dataset. By performing dimension-
ality reduction in two stages, this method effectively reduces dimensionality of dataset
with  minimal  compromise  on  accuracy,  making  it  convenient  for  handling  large-scale
datasets incrementally.

3.5  Hybrid DNN-BiLSTM model

In the preprocessing phase, there is a crucial step of refining data to organize incoming
packet data efficiently. Many datasets utilized for cyber attack detection contain numer-
ous attributes. However, utilizing all these attributes for cyber attack identification with-
out refinement can result in a decline in performance due to overfitting concerns. DNN
is  able  to  learn  the  potential  information  hidden  by  features  compared  with  shallow

Misrak and Melaku Discover Internet of Things            (2025) 5:97 Page 16 of 34

learning models such as machine learning and has a more concise network structure to
extract nonlinear features of network data compared with deep learning models. There-
fore, DNN is selected as the network structure to optimize the deep nonlinear feature
extraction ability of BiLSTM.

To get control of the issue, this study proposes an innovative approach which is hybrid
deep learning that integrates DNN with BiLSTM, as shown in Fig. 2. This combination
is designed to upgrade the model’s capacity for the extraction of nonlinear features while
leveraging BiLSTM’s inherent capacity to capture bidirectional long-distance dependen-
cies.  The  integration  of  DNN  with  BiLSTM  enhances  cyber  threat  detection  by  com-
bining deep feature extraction with temporal context modeling. This hybrid architecture
captures complex patterns and sequential dependencies, leading to improved accuracy
in identifying diverse and evolving IoT-based attacks. Additionally, DNN handles high-
dimensional data effectively, and contributes to model generalizability, making it adapt-
able across different IoT environments and new, unseen attack patterns.

3.6  Model lightweighting

According research by [20] there are several techniques possible to utilize to make deep
learning  algorithms  more  lightweight,  and  therefore  more  suitable  for  deployment  on
resource-constrained devices. Lightweighting techniques are detailed in Sect. 3.6.1.

3.6.1  Lightweighting techniques

  • Quantization:  This  involves  reducing  the  precision  of  the  weights  and  activations
in  the  network,  typically  from  32-bit  floating  point  to  8-bit  integers.  This  can
significantly  reduce  the  memory  and  computational  requirements  of  the  network
without significantly affecting accuracy.

  • Pruning:  This  involves  removing  unimportant  connections  from  the  network,
typically  those  with  small  weights.  This  can  significantly  reduce  the  size  of  the
network without significantly affecting accuracy.

  • Knowledge distillation: This involves training a smaller “student” network to mimic

the output of a larger “teacher” network.

  • Architecture optimization: This involves designing or selecting an architecture that

is specifically optimized for the target device.

  • Quantized  neural  networks:  This  involves  training  the  network  directly  in

quantized form, rather than quantizing it after training.

Fig. 2  DNN_BiLSTM Model Structure

Page 17 of 34

  • Model  compression:  This

involves  compressing  the  network  by  removing

redundancies and decreasing the number of parameters.

For this thesis work based on the consideration to produce a model which is lightweight,
short training, and time of inference, an advanced dynamic quantization (QAT + PTDQ)
was used and as detailed in Sect. 3.6.2.

3.6.2  Advanced dynamic quantization

Advanced quantization is an optimization strategy utilized to decrease the bit width of
model parameters from 32-bit floating-point to achieve better resolution and efficiency.
It  is  significantly  enhanced  by  employing  advanced  dynamic  quatization  a  combined
approach  of  quantization-aware  training  (QAT)  and  post-training  dynamic  quantiza-
tion (PTDQ) techniques. QAT integrates the considerations of quantization effects into
the process of training, guaranteeing that the model adapts effectively to the constraints
imposed by lower bit-width representations. This proactive approach results in models
that  are  inherently  more  robust  to  quantization,  leading  to  better  performance  post-
quantization compared to conventional methods.

By incorporating QAT to the training process, the model will becomes more resilient
to variations in data distribution and noise, leading to enhanced generalizability across
diverse datasets. QAT enables the earning capability to the model robust features that
are less sensitive to quantization-induced distortions, thereby facilitating better adapta-
tion to unseen data during inference.

Furthermore, the utilization of post-training dynamic quantization techniques ensures
that the model’s performance remains consistent across different deployment scenarios.
These  techniques  optimize  the  quantization  process  while  preserving  crucial  informa-
tion, thus minimizing the risk of accuracy degradation on real-world data.

The combined approach of QAT and advanced quantization not only optimizes model
efficiency  but  also  enhances  its  generalizability  to  novel,  unseen  data.  This  is  particu-
larly  crucial in real-world  applications where models must perform consistently under
various  settings  and  datasets,  ensuring  consistent  and  accurate  results  across  different
environments.

3.6.3  Quantized DNN_BiLSTMQ model

The workflow of the quantized model is as follows.

  • Train the DNN-BiLSTM model using full-precision (FP32) weights.
  • Apply  quantization-aware  training  (QAT)  with  low-precision  (e.g.,  INT8)  effects

during fine-tuning.

  • Perform post-training dynamic quantization on linear layers to convert weights and

activations to low-bit representations.

  • Export the quantized model for deployment in resource-constrained environments.
  • Run  model  inference  using  optimized  integer  arithmetic,  significantly  reducing
memory usage and computational load while maintaining detection performance.

Remarkable proficiency in discerning intricate data patterns compared to conventional
machine learning models, its streamlined network structure excels in extracting nonlin-
ear features from network data, surpassing even the most intricate deep learning archi-
tectures  in  terms  of  simplicity  and  efficiency.  Consequently,  we  have  opted  for  DNN

Misrak and Melaku Discover Internet of Things            (2025) 5:97 Page 18 of 34

as the foundational structure to bolster BiLSTM’s deep extraction of nonlinear feature
capabilities.

However, mixing of multiple network structures often leads to bloated model param-
eters,  resulting  in  escalated  computational  demands.  Given  the  critical  demand  for  a
lightweight  hybrid  deep  learning  based  cyber  attack  detection  system  capable  of  real-
time  detection  in  resource-constrained  IoT  settings,  it  becomes  paramount  to  strike  a
delicate balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency.

In  this  investigation,  we  have  implemented  an  advanced  quantization  approach,  a
sophisticated blend of quantization-aware training and post-training dynamic quantiza-
tion, to compress the blended DNN-BiLSTM model. This innovative approach curtails
the size and complicatedness of the model while preserving its feature extraction prow-
ess and detection accuracy, thus facilitating seamless deployment in IoT environments
characterized  by  limited  resources.  This  approach  improves  model  generalizability  by
leveraging  Quantization-Aware  Training  to  preserve  critical  features  during  training,
followed  by  Post-Training  Dynamic  Quantization,  which  adapts  the  model  efficiently
during  inference  without  significant  loss  of  accuracy  and  enhances  its  generalization
capabilities.

The model architecture and development process of our proposed DNN-BiLSTM with
quantization  (DNN-BiLSTMQ)  approach  are  meticulously  detailed  in  Fig.  3  which  is
adopted from [8] and modified for advanced quantization.

3.7  Advanced model optimization

This study employs the optimization with Optuna hyperparameter methodology to opti-
mize hyperparameters associated with model detection, aiming to enhance model clas-
sification accuracy. Optuna, introduced by [45], represents a contemporary approach to
hyperparameter optimization frameworks. It conceptualizes hyperparameter optimiza-
tion  as  an  iterative  process  aimed  at  maximizing  or  minimizing  an  objective  function,
wherein the function yields an assessment score corresponding to input hyper-param-
eter sets. The advancement of Optuna over conventional manual and automated tuning
methodologies is predominantly evident in three key dimensions [46].

3.7.1  Advantages of optuna

  • Flexible  Parameter  Search  Space:  Optuna  facilitates  dynamic  construction  of  the
parameter  search  space,  empowering  users  to  adaptively  define  hyperparameter
ranges  for  individual  models.  Subsequently,  it  generates  the  objective  function
according  to  interactions  with  the  experimental  entity.  The  subsequent  search
strategy  is  informed  by  historical  evaluations  of  previous  experiments,  guiding  the
validation of forthcoming sets of hyperparameters.

  • Efficient  Optimization:  Optuna  incorporates  efficient  optimization  technique,
encompassing  state-of-the-art  hyperparameter  sampling  techniques  and  pruning
algorithms  designed  to  terminate  unpromising  trails.  By  employing  both  relational
and  standalone  sampling  methodologies,  Optuna  swiftly  identifies  optimal  search
spaces.  The  pruning  algorithms  facilitate  the  premature  termination  of  futile  trails
during  training,  a  strategy  commonly  known  as  automated  early  halting.  These
optimization  algorithms  are  particularly  critical  for  enhancing  performance  in
resource-constrained scenarios.

  • Versatile  and  Scalable:  Optuna  boasts  a  generic  architecture  and  straightforward
setup  procedure,  rendering  it  applicable  across  diverse  experimental  contexts.  Its
interactive  interface  facilitates  seamless  deployment  of  lightweight  experiments
onto  large-scale  distributed  computing  platforms,  thereby  meeting  the  demand  for
scalable experimentation.

3.7.2  Advanced optuna implementation strategy

To apply Optuna in this research, we integrate it with DNN-BiLSTM model enhanced
with  quantization-aware  training.  Algorithm  2  outlines  the  Optuna  hyperparameter
optimization procedure, which is pivotal in enhancing the detection approach proposed
in this research. The algorithm takes as input the dataset, the desired trial number, and
the hyperparameters that will optimized along with their respective search spaces. Ini-
tially, the raw dataset undergoes preprocessing to RAL-MIFS and then goes to two stage
IPCA-dimensional and split data into training and test datasets.

Subsequently,  the  objective  function  for  optimization  is  defined.  For  the  detection
approach proposed herein, the hyperparameters subject to optimization include learn-
ing  rate,  batch_size,  and  weight_decay.  Accordingly,  the  search  space  of  hyper-param-
eters  is  delineated  within  the  objective  function  definition  to  facilitate  subsequent
hyperparameter sampling. The test efficacy of post-model training and testing serves as
the objective function’s return value, thereby evaluating the identification performance
of different trial.

Following the objective function definition, the optimization process will be instanti-
ated, specifying whether the goal is to maximize or minimize the outcome of objective
function.  In  this  research,  the  objective  is  to  get  hyperparameter  values  that  yield  the
maximum test accuracy within the designated space.

Finally, the optimization commences by setting the amount of trials that will be exe-
cuted. Optuna iteratively refines the hyperparameter combination within the designated
search space using the hyperparameter algorithm across performed trials. It’s pertinent
that the implementation encompasses RAL-MIFS + two-stage IPCA approach alongside
the incorporation of quantization aware training.

The study [47] highlights the critical influence of learning rate, batch size, and weight
decay on the performance of deep learning models, demonstrating that careful hyperpa-
rameter optimization substantially improves training stability, convergence, and general-
ization. The learning rate, batch size, and weight decay were selected for hyperparameter
optimization using Optuna due to their significant impact on the convergence behavior,
training stability, and generalization capacity of deep neural networks. The learning rate
controls  the  step  size  during  gradient  descent  and  plays  a  crucial  role  in  determining
the speed and stability of convergence. Batch size influences the stochasticity of gradi-
ent  estimates,  thereby  affecting  both  training  dynamics  and  computational  efficiency.
Weight  decay  serves  as  a  regularization  technique  that  penalizes  large  weights,  thus
helping to mitigate overfitting. By optimizing these parameters with Optuna, the model
achieves optimal performance through an efficient balance between convergence speed
and generalization to unseen data.

frequency of 2.80GHz and turbocharging up to 2701 MHz, this processor’s four physical
cores and eight logical processors efficiently handled the computational demands.

Additionally, the system boasted 16 GB of RAM, ensuring sufficient memory resources
to  accommodate  intricate  computational  workflows  without  performance  bottlenecks.
This combination of processing power and memory capacity facilitated seamless execu-
tion  and  swift  completion  of  the  evaluation  processes,  ensuring  optimal  performance
and resource utilization throughout the assessment.

4.1.2  Evaluation metrices

This  research  introduces  an  evaluation  framework  to  assess  IoT  attack  identification
model  effectiveness.  Given  the  complexities  in  IoT  attack  detection,  the  evaluation
expands beyond traditional metrics to include model size, computation time, inference
time, and FLOPs. Model size is crucial, impacting deployment on resource-constrained
IoT  devices,  necessitating  efficient  memory  use.  Computation  and  inference  times
are  critical,  especially  in  real-time  IoT  where  swift  threat  detection  is  vital.  Consider-
ing FLOPs helps understand computational overhead, guiding deployment decisions in
diverse IoT environments.

The evaluation framework includes metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, assess-
ing  false  positives,  true  positives,  and  balancing  both  types  of  errors.  Precision  mini-
mizes  false  alarms,  while  recall  identifies  genuine  attacks.  The  F1-score,  harmonizing
precision  and  recall,  provides  a  balanced  evaluation.  By  integrating  these  metrics,  the
research aims to comprehensively assess the model’s performance, facilitating informed
deployment  decisions  in  IoT  ecosystems.  This  approach  addresses  challenges  in  IoT
attack  detection,  contributing  to  robust  security  solutions  tailored  to  IoT  deployment
needs.

reduce CIC-IDS2017 dataset features from 78 to 26 features while maintaining an accu-
racy of 99.753%

Experimental  results  shows  that  the  RAL-MIFS  with  two-stage  IPCA  method  sig-
nificantly  enhances  the  detection  efficiency  of  cyber  attacks.  Specifically,  by  reducing
CIC-IDS2017 dataset features from 78 to 26, the RA-MIFS + two-stage IPCA method
achieves an accuracy of 99.753%, outperforming single stage RAL-MIFS + IPCA tech-
niques. This substantial improvement underscores the effectiveness of the RAL-MIFS +
two-stage IPCA method in extracting the most vital features and thereby enhancing the
performance of cyber attack detection of the model and its generalizablity.

Practically  speaking,  the  experiments  validate  the  performance  superiority  of  RAL-
MIFS  +  two-stage  IPCA  over  RAL-MIFS  +  IPCA,  indicating  its  effectiveness  in  intru-
sion detection scenarios. Furthermore, this study conducts a comparison of the optimal
identification efficacy of RAL-MIFS + two stage IPCA reduction algorithms using CIC-
IDS2017  dataset,  wherein  the  two-stage  IPCA  algorithm  surpasses  others  regarding
precision,  accuracy,  recall,  and  F1-score.  A  comprehensive  performance  comparison
is  depicted  in  Fig.  4.  In  summary,  the  RAL-MIFS  +  two-stage  IPCA  algorithm  chosen
in this research outperforms widely used feature engineering technique in the test and
demonstrates outstanding performance.

4.2.2  Performance measures on CIC-IDS2017 dataset

To  ascertain  the  applicability  of  our  proposed  architecture  for  IoT  attack  recognition,
this subsection undertakes a comparative analysis between the DNN-BiLSTMQ model
and  its  constituent  sub-models,  namely  DNN  and  BiLSTM,  through  rigorous  experi-
mentation. Furthermore, it juxtaposes our model against a spectrum of widely used DL
models  across  several  performance  parameters,  including  accuracy,  recall,  precision,
F1-score, time of training and time of inference. The results of these comparative experi-
ments are meticulously documented in Table 4. Given the inherent complexities of ML
models, particularly in terms of training and inference times. For the data partitioning
procedure, data is randomly divided into into 80 % training, 20% testing, and then fur-
ther divide the training set to training and validation 80% and 20% respectively. Finally,
data  was  fed  to  deep  learning  model.  The  result  is  based  on  optimization  parameters:
batch_size:  148,  lr:  0.0018895  weight_decay:  1.44357
.  These  hyperparameters

From the comparison, it is evident that:

  • For  accuracy,  the  DNN-BiLSTMQ  model  achieves  99.73%,  which  is  0.06%,  0.22%,

and 0.08% better than BiLSTM, CNN, and DNN, respectively.

  • For  precision,  the  DNN-BiLSTMQ  model  obtains  99.57%,  which  is  0.04%,  0.10%,

and 0.08% better than BiLSTM, CNN, and DNN, respectively.

  • For recall, the DNN-BiLSTMQ model achieves 99.73%, which is 0.06%, 0.22%, and

0.08% better than BiLSTM, CNN, and DNN, respectively.

  • For the F1-score, the DNN-BiLSTMQ model obtains 99.64%, which is 0.05%, 0.16%,

and 0.08% better than BiLSTM, CNN, and DNN, respectively.

As evidenced in Table 4, the DNN-BiLSTMQ model emerges as the frontrunner, demon-
strating unparalleled performance across all evaluation metrics, with accuracy, F1-score,
recall,  and  precision  surpassing  the  99.57%  threshold. This  exceptional  performance  is
due  to  RAL-MIFS  +  two  stage  IPCA  with  the  synergistic  fusion  of  feature  extraction
capabilities  from  DNN  and  BiLSTM  algorithms  encapsulated  within  the  DNN-BiL-
STMQ framework, facilitating a more holistic feature representation.

Despite  advanced  dynamic  quantization  efforts  aimed  at  model  generalization  with
the help of QAT and PTDQ and reducing model size by one-third, it is observed to com-
promise  detection  performance  by  small  amount.  However,  the  incorporation  of  the
DNN  component  within  the  DNN-BiLSTMQ  architecture  effectively  mitigates  these
deficiencies, endowing the model with enhanced classification prowess while maintain-
ing computational efficiency compared to standalone local algorithms.

Noteworthy is the DNN-BiLSTMQ model’s expedited test time relative to its counter-
parts, albeit at the sacrifice of prolonged training time of CNN and BiLSTM models. This
disparity  is  attributed  to  the  unified  architectural  design  of  DNN-BiLSTMQ,  wherein
DNN and BiLSTM are seamlessly integrated while leveraging quantization-aware train-
ing during training, which helps in model generalizability and to extract more important
features. While this integration does confer substantial computational advantages dur-
ing training, its efficacy becomes discernible during the test stage, particularly with the
employment of dynamic quantization post-training.

Complementing these quantitative assessments, Figs. 5, 6, 7, and 8 visually encapsu-
lates the prediction outcomes of the DNN-BiLSTMQ model juxtaposed with other com-
parative models across diverse sample categories within CIC-IDS2017 dataset, presented

model  surpasses  alternative  models  in  identifying  recent  attack  data  across  all  evalua-
tion parameters. Notably, this model demonstrates shorter training and test times, par-
ticularly  when  contrasted  with  DNN  models,  where  it  exhibits  a  notable  advantage  in

tage, including improvements of at least 0.06% in accuracy, 0.03% in precision, 0.06% in

4.5  Deployment architecture

Deploying  the  model  in  real-world  smart  homes  requires  a  careful  balance  between
accuracy, latency, and resource efficiency. While the model’s compact design suits low-
power edge devices, its performance across diverse IoT platforms must be optimized for
minimal delay and robust attack detection. Scalability is also crucial, as the model must
adapt to both small-scale and large IoT environments. This research [49] offers comple-
mentary  insights  on  lightweight  AI  models  for  IoT  security,  which  can  further  inform
the optimization of model to ensure high detection accuracy while maintaining compu-
tational efficiency.

In  edge  computing,  data  processing  occurs  at  the  network  edge,  near  data  sources,
reducing reliance on cloud or fog infrastructure [50]. In smart home automation, edge
devices  serve  as  intermediaries  between  IoT  nodes  and  cloud  servers,  enabling  low-
latency  processing  and  quick  response  times.  Fog  computing  [51]  extends  cloud  capa-
bilities by offering localized computing, storage, and networking closer to IoT devices.
As a middleware layer, it reduces latency through distributed processing across hetero-
geneous nodes.

Cyber attack detection in IoT networks [52] typically employs host-based or network-
based  architectures  [50].  Host-based  systems  run  on  individual  IoT  or  fog  devices  to
monitor  localized  activity,  while  network-based  systems  analyze  traffic  at  gateways  to
detect distributed threats.

A  Hybrid  Deep  Learning-based  Host-Based  Attack  Detection  System  (HDL-ADS)  is
proposed, optimized for low-power IoT devices at the fog layer, as illustrated in Fig. 13.
Designed  for  real-time  smart  home  environments,  HDL-ADS  operates  on  AI-enabled
edge  chips,  enabling  fast,  microcontroller  platforms,  offline  inference  with  minimal
memory  usage.  This  edge  deployment  reduces  latency,  avoids  cloud  dependency,  and
mitigates data leakage risks. However, the compact model size imposes a trade-off with
accuracy.

HDL-ADS  focuses  solely  on  inbound  traffic,  assuming  device  trustworthiness.  For
enhanced security, a complementary Network-Based Attack Detection System (NADS)
can be deployed at the fog node, leveraging more computational resources and hardware
acceleration for deep learning tasks.

libraries optimized for 32-bit ARM Cortex-M-based microcontrollers, such as Arduino,
ESP32, and similar devices.

Two deployment methods are used for host-based detection:

  • Direct  Hardware  Deployment:  The  model  runs  on  devices  like  Arduino  Portenta

H7, STM32 Nucleo, and Raspberry Pi 3B+/4.

  • Source Code Integration: The model is converted into .h and .c files and embedded

into the main firmware of the microcontroller.

The proposed model supports both methods, offering a flexible deployment strategy that
enables seamless adaptation across heterogeneous hardware. To enhance real-time per-
formance and minimize latency, the model is deployed on a fog node located after the
gateway, utilizing its computational capabilities for efficient and low-latency inference.

This research model was experimentally validated on two distinct real-time heteroge-
neous IoT datasets, ensuring interoperability and adaptability to different and emerging
attack types.

The model employs a dual-stage feature selection mechanism, combining RAL-MIFS
with two-stage IPCA. This approach effectively identifies the most relevant features from
diverse, real-time, and heterogeneous IoT datasets, improving both efficiency and inter-
pretability. By selecting the most informative features, the model ensures its interoper-
ability and scalability, making it adaptable to a wide range of IoT settings.

Furthermore, the model incorporates a hybrid architecture that combines DNN-BiL-
STM models, enhanced with advanced dynamic quantization for improved performance
and  reduced  computational  overhead.  This  architecture  significantly  boosts  accu-
racy  and  interpretability,  making  it  suitable  for  real-time  inference  even  on  resource-
constrained  edge  devices.  The  dynamic  quantization  further  optimizes  the  model  for
deployment on edge devices, ensuring both efficiency and scalability. The model remains
adaptable to both edge and fog computing nodes, delivering robust low-latency perfor-
mance while ensuring security across diverse IoT environments.

5  Conclusion and future works

In addressing the challenges posed by large-scale, sophisticated IoT cyber attack identi-
fication and classification, besides the need for lightweight and real-time detection and
classification solutions, this research proposes a hybrid DL based cyber attack identifica-
tion and classification system integrating DNN and BiLSTM model.

Our  proposed  methodology  introduces  a  novel  RAL-MIFS  +  two-stage  IPCA  tech-
niques for reducing feature dimension during data preprocessing. It leverages DNN-BiL-
STM architectures to extract nonlinear, bidirectional long-range features from network
data. Furthermore, we use advanced dynamic quantization and Optuna hyperparameter
optimization  to  model  unit  structure  pre  and  post-training,  resulting  in  a  DNN-BiL-
STMQ (Quantized) model tailored for lightweight cyber attack detection.

To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we have done an experiments using CIC-
IDS2017  and  CIC-IoT2023  datasets,  which  simulate  industrial  and  network  IoT  envi-
ronments. Our experiment demonstrates superior detection performance compared to
existing methods across both datasets. Additionally, our approach offers smaller model
sizes and lower complexities compared to alternative detection methods.

The  proposed  methodology  in  this  research  demonstrates  commendable  detec-
tion  performance  and  exhibits  a  lightweight  nature.  The  implementation  of  advanced
dynamic quantization which integrates quantization aware training + dynamic quantiza-
tion for post training makes model generalizability excellent.

However, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations. The experiment took more
training time and might not fully emulate the intricacies and dynamics of IoT network
environments. Therefore, it is a necessity to subject the model to rigorous testing using
more intricate datasets by integrating real-time test. Furthermore, it will contribute to
fortifying  the  robustness  and  reliability  of  the  detection  and  classification  mechanism
developed.  Future  work  can  be  done  on  further  reducing  the  training  time  and  model
size.
